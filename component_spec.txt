# A component is basically an array with values meant to represent a graphical
# element drawn in the game

# Rect :
["rect", start_x, start_y, width, length]

# Line :
["line", start_x, start_y, width, length]

# Slider :
["slider", direction, start_x, start_y, width, length,
	slide_time, lifetime, children]
# direction is either "rtl" (right to left) or "ltr" (left to right)
# slide_time is the amount of frames for the element to appear and disappear
# lifetime is the amount of frames during which the slider will stay still
# children is an array of components to be drawn in the slider
# Note: all coordinates for children elements depend on the top left-hand corner
# of the slider
# Note: a slider shouldn't contain another slider, otherwise you'll end up with
# some slide-ception style mess
