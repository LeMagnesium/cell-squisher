      <p>The game is about vengance, on the vicious cells rebelling in the Petri dish. Your score is important, keep an eye on it.</p>
      <p>When a cell is squished by your scientific wrath (in the form of your 7 digits smasher hand), it will become dark and die, </p>
      <p>offering all its health to the powers of science. When a cell manages to escape your anger, it robs 10 points from your</p>
      <p>score along the way! When you squish a cell as another one is dying, you increase your combo. As long as you squish cells </p>
      <p>while others are still dying, your combo increases, to fall back to 0 when no cell is dying. Overlapping cells offer a </p>
      <p>bonus of 50 points for each cell after the first one.</p>
      <p>Now go! THOSE CELLS SHALL FEEL THE WRAATH OF SCIEENCE!</p>
